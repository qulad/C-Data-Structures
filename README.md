# C-Data-Structures
Basic data structures (Node, Linked List, Stack and Queue) coded in C++


Compile with ```g++ {file_name} -o {output_name} -fconcepts```

This code was a part of my BÄ°L311: Algorithm Analysis and Design course. The goal is to understanding basic data structures and implementing in C++

Note:
BFS and DFS are not 100% functional
